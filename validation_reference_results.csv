P011,"The claim for collecting venous blood by venipuncture (CPT code 36415) has been approved. This procedure is covered under the policy for treating urinary tract infection (N39.0), which matches the patient’s diagnosis. The patient, a 16-year-old female, meets all eligibility criteria, and no preauthorization is required."
P012,"The claim for the complete blood count (CPT code 85025) cannot be automatically approved, as the patient’s age of 46 exceeds the policy's allowed age range of 18 to 45. Although the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (F32.9) is covered, the age requirement is not met. Therefore, the claim needs to be routed for further manual review."
P013,"The claim for the chest X-ray (CPT code 71020) cannot be automatically approved, as the policy only covers this procedure for the diagnosis of low back pain (M54.5). The patient’s diagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (K21.9) does not align with the policy’s covered conditions. Although the patient's age and gender meet the policy requirements, the diagnosis does not match the criteria for coverage. Therefore, the claim needs to be routed for further manual review."
P014,"The claim for collecting venous blood by venipuncture (CPT code 36415) has been approved. This procedure is covered under the policy for the patient’s diagnosis of low back pain (M54.5). The patient is 14 years old, which falls within the covered age range of 11 to 27, and there are no gender-based restrictions. Preauthorization isn’t required, but it was obtained, and all policy requirements have been satisfied."
P015,"The claim for the procedure (CPT code 36415 – Collection of venous blood by venipuncture) cannot be automatically approved, as the patient’s age of 65 falls outside the allowed age range of 18 to 49 specified in the policy guidelines. Although the diagnosis (G43.909 – Migraine, unspecified, not intractable, without status migrainosus) and the procedure are covered, the age requirement is not met. As a result, the claim needs to be routed for further manual review."
P016,"The claim for the office visit (CPT code 99213) has been approved. This procedure is covered under the policy for the patient’s diagnosis of essential hypertension (I10). The patient, a 17-year-old male, meets all eligibility criteria, and no preauthorization is required for this service."
P017,"The claim for the electrocardiogram (CPT code 93000) has been approved. This procedure is covered under the policy for the diagnosis of low back pain (M54.5).

P018,"The claim for the office visit (CPT code 99213) has been approved. The procedure is covered under the policy for the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified (J44.9). The patient meets all policy criteria—he is 84 years old (within the allowed age range of 82 to 92) and male, as required. Preauthorization was not required. However, it was obtained. Since all coverage conditions are met, the claim is approved."
P019,"The claim for the Hemoglobin glycosylated A1c test (CPT code 83036) cannot be automatically approved, as the patient’s age of 55 falls outside the allowed age range of 34 to 44 specified in the policy. Although the diagnosis (K21.9 – Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis) is covered, the age requirement is not met. Therefore, the claim needs to be routed for further manual review."
P020,"The claim for the diagnostic colonoscopy (CPT code 45378) cannot be automatically approved due to a gender restriction in the policy, which only covers this procedure for males. While the patient’s diagnosis (K21.9 – Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis) and age of 71 meet the policy requirements, the gender restriction prevents coverage. As a result, the claim needs to be routed for further manual review."
